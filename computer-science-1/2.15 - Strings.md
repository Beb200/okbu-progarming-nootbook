# Describe the Java string data type
A string is a sequence of characters.
A string literal surrounds a character sequence with double quotes, as in `"Hello"`, `"52 Main St."`, or `"42"`, vs. an integer literal like 42 or character literal like 'a'.
Various characters may be in a string, such as letters, numbers, spaces, or symbols like $ or %, as in `"$100 for Julia!!"`.
Earlier sections showed string literals being output, as in: `System.out.print("Hello");`.

- `"Hey"`
- `"Hey there."`
- `"674"`
- `"a"`

# Describe the difference between next() and nextLine() in the Scanner class
Sometimes a programmer wishes to get whitespace characters into a string, such as getting a user's input of the name "Franklin D. Roosevelt" into a string variable presidentName.
For such cases, the language supports getting an entire line into a string. 
The method `scnr.nextLine()` gets all remaining text on the current input line, up to the next newline character (which is removed from input but not put in stringVar).
Mixing `next()` and `nextLine()` can be tricky, because `next()` leaves the newline in the input, while `nextLine()` does not skip leading whitespace.
