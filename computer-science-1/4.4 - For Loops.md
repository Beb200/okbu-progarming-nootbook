# Demonstrate Java implementation of a for loop (provide example code)
A loop commonly must iterate a specific number of times, such as 10 times.
Though achievable with a while loop, that situation is so common that a special kind of loop exists.
A for loop is a loop with three parts at the top: a loop variable initialization, a loop expression, and a loop variable update.
A for loop describes iterating a specific number of times more naturally than a while loop.
```
for (initialExpression; conditionExpression; updateExpression) {
  // Loop body
}
// Statements after the loop
```
# Compare and contrast for and while loops
Generally, a programmer uses a for loop when the number of iterations is known (like loop 5 times, or loop numItems times), and a while loop otherwise.

for -	Number of iterations is computable before the loop, like iterating N times.

while -	Number of iterations is not (easily) computable before the loop, like iterating until the input is 'q'.


# Demonstrate Java implementation of a for loop to find the maximum value in a list (provide example code)
```
import java.util.Scanner;

// Outputs max of list of integers
// First value indicates list size
// Ex: 4 -1 9 0 3  yields 9

public class ListMax {
   public static void main(String [] args) {
      Scanner scnr = new Scanner(System.in);
      int maxSoFar = 0;
      int currValue;
      int numValues;
      int i;

      numValues = scnr.nextInt();

      for (i = 0; i < numValues; ++i) {
         currValue = scnr.nextInt();

         if (i == 0) { // First iteration
            maxSoFar = currValue;
         }
         else if (currValue > maxSoFar) {
            maxSoFar = currValue;
         }
      }

      if (numValues > 0) {
         System.out.println("Max: " + maxSoFar);
      }
   }
}
```
