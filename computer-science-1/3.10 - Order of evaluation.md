# List the Java order of evaluation rules for arithmetic, logical and relational operators
The order in which operators are evaluated in an expression are known as precedence rules.
Arithmetic, logical, and relational operators are evaluated in the order shown below.
|Operator/Convention| Description|	Explanation|
|---|---|---|
|( )|	Items within parentheses are evaluated first|	In (a * (b + c)) - d, the + is evaluated first, then *, then -.|
|!	|! (logical NOT) is next|	! x || y is evaluated as (!x) || y|
|* / % + -	|Arithmetic operators (using their precedence rules; see earlier section)|	z - 45 * y < 53 evaluates * first, then -, then <.|
|<   <=   >   >=	|Relational operators|	x < 2 \|\| x >= 10 is evaluated as (x < 2) \|\| (x >= 10) because < and >= have precedence over \|\|.|
|==   != |	Equality and inequality operators|	x == 0 && x != 10 is evaluated as (x == 0) && (x != 10) because == and != have precedence over &&. == and != have the same precedence and are evaluated left to right.|
|&&|	Logical AND |	x == 5 \|\| y == 10 && z != 10 is evaluated as (x == 5) \|\| ((y == 10) && (z != 10)) because && has precedence over \|\|.|
| \|\| |	Logical OR	| \|\| has the lowest precedence of the listed arithmetic, logical, and relational operators.|
