# Describe incremental program development
Creating correct programs can be hard.
Following a good programming process helps.
What many new programmers do, but shouldn't, is write the entire program, compile it, and run itâ€”hoping it works.
Debugging such a program can be difficult because there may be many distinct bugs.

Experienced programmers develop programs incrementally, meaning they create a simple program version, and then grow the program little-by-little into successively more-complete versions.

# Describe the purpose of "FIXME" or "TODO" comments
A FIXME comment is commonly used to indicate program parts to be fixed or added, as below.
Some editor tools automatically highlight the FIXME comment to attract the programmer's attention.
