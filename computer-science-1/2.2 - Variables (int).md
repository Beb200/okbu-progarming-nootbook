# Demonstrate (give an example) of a Java declaration of an integer variable and assignment and an integer literal and an expression

# Describe the allocation process and its role in variable declarations
A variable declaration is a statement that declares a new variable, specifying the variable's name and type. Ex: int userAge; declares a new variable named userAge that can hold an integer value. The compiler allocates a memory location for userAge capable of storing an integer. Allocation is the process of determining a suitable memory location to store data like variables. Ex: In the code above, the compiler has given userAge memory location 97, which is known as the variable's address. The choice of 97 is arbitrary and irrelevant to the programmer, but the idea that a variable corresponds to a memory location is important to understand.

When a statement that assigns a variable with a value executes, the processor writes the value into the variable's memory location. Likewise, reading a variable's value reads the value from the variable's memory location. The programmer must declare a variable before any statement that assigns or reads the variable, so that the variable's memory location is known.
