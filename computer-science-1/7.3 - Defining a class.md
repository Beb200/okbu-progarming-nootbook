# Describe the purpose and use of private fields
In addition to public member methods, a class definition has private fields: variables that member methods can access but class users cannot.
The private access modifier precedes each private field declaration.

# Describe a (class) method definition
A programmer defining a class first names the class, declares private fields, and defines public member methods.
A class' fields and methods are collectively called class members.

The programmer defines the details of each member method, sometimes called the class' implementation.
A method definition provides an access modifier, return type, name, parameters, and the method's statements.
A member method can access all private fields.
