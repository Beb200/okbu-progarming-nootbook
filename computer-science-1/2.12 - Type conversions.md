# Describe the need for type conversions
A type conversion is a conversion of one data type to another, such as an int to a double. 
The compiler automatically performs several common conversions between int and double types, such automatic conversions are known as implicit conversion.

# Describe implicit type conversion
A type cast explicitly converts a value of one type to another type. 
A programmer can precede an expression with (type) to convert the expression's value to the indicated type. 

# Demonstrate the use of type casting in Java (no answer is needed in the homework)
If `myIntVar` is 7, then `(double)myIntVar` converts int 7 to double 7.0.
