# Describe integer overflow
An integer variable cannot store a number larger than the maximum supported by the variable's data type. 
An overflow occurs when the value being assigned to a variable is greater than the maximum value the variable can store.

A common error is to try to store a value greater than about 2 billion into an int variable. 
For example, the decimal number 4,294,967,297 requires 33 bits in binary, namely 100000000000000000000000000000001 (we chose the decimal number for easy binary viewing).
Trying to assign that number into an int results in overflow. 
The 33rd bit is lost and only the lower 32 bits are stored, namely 00000000000000000000000000000001, which is decimal number 1.
