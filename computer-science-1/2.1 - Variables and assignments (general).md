# Describe and give an example of a variable
  In a program, a variable is a named item, such as `x` or `numPeople`, used to hold a value.

# Describe and given an example of an assignment
  An assignment assigns a variable with a value, such as `x = 5`.
  That assignment means x is assigned with 5, and x keeps that value during subsequent assignments, until x is assigned again.
  
  Examples:
  - `x = 3;`
  - `numPeople = 4;`
  - `sizeOfTexas = 120000;`
  - `z = x + y;`
