# Describe a nested loop
A nested loop is a loop that appears in the body of another loop.
The nested loops are commonly referred to as the inner loop and outer loop.
Nested loops have various uses.
One use is to generate all combinations of some items.

# Demonstrate Java implementation of a nested loop (show code example)
```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class DomainNamePrinter {

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      char letter1;
      char letter2;

      System.out.println("Two-letter domain names:");

      letter1 = 'a';
      while (letter1 <= 'z') {
         letter2 = 'a';
         while (letter2 <= 'z') {
            System.out.println("" + letter1 + "" + letter2 + ".com");
            ++letter2;
         }
         ++letter1;
      }
   }
}
