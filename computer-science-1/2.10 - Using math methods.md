# Explain the purpose and use of the math library / class
A standard Math class has about 30 math operations, known as methods. 
The Math class is part of Java's standard language package, so no import is required.

# Describe the purpose and use (give examples) of a method
A method is a list of statements executed by invoking the method's name, such invoking is known as a method call. 
Any method input values, or arguments, appear within ( ), separated by commas if more than one.
A programmer must precede the method name with `Math.` to call a Math class method. 
Below, the method `Math.sqrt()` is called with one argument, areaSquare. 
The method call evaluates to a value, as in `Math.sqrt(areaSquare)` below evaluating to 7.0, with which sideSquare is assigned.

|Method|Behavior|Example|
|------|--------|--------|
|sqrt(x)| Square root of x|	Math.sqrt(9.0) evaluates to 3.0.|
|pow(x, y)|	Power: x^y^  |Math.pow(6.0, 2.0) evaluates to 36.0.|
|abs(x)|	Absolute value of x|	Math.abs(-99.5) evaluates to 99.5.|
