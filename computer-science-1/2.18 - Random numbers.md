      System.out.print("Move from ");
      System.out.print("row " + rowNumL + " col " + colNumL);
      System.out.print(" to ");

Output:
Move from row 7 col 6 to row 8 col 16

# Describe a pseudo random number and how that is different from a random number
The integers generated by a Random object are known as pseudo-random. 
"Pseudo" means "not actually, but having the appearance of". 
Internally, the `nextInt()` method has an equation to compute the next "random" integer from the previous one, (invisibly) keeping track of the previous one. 
For the first call to `nextInt()`, no previous random integer exists, so the method uses an integer known as the seed. 
`Random()` seeds the pseudo-random number generator with a number based on the current time. 
Since, the time is different for each program run, the program will get a unique sequence.

Reproducibility is important for testing some programs. 
(Players of classic arcade games like Pac-man may notice that the seemingly-random actions of objects actually follow the same pattern every time the game is played, allowing players to master the game by repeating the same winning actions).
A programmer can specify the seed when the Random object is created, as in `Random randGen = new Random(5);` or using the `setSeed()` method, as in `randGen.setSeed(5);` With a specific seed, each program run will yield the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers.

Example:
```
import java.util.Random;

public class SeededRandomValues {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Random randGen = new Random(15);  // Seed with 15

      System.out.println(randGen.nextInt());
      System.out.println(randGen.nextInt());
      System.out.println(randGen.nextInt());
   }
}
```
