# Describe the Java identifier rules
A name created by a programmer for an item like a variable or method is called an identifier. 

An identifier must:

- be a sequence of letters (a-z, A-Z), underscore (_), dollar signs ($), and digits (0-9)
- start with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign

Note that "_", called an underscore, and "$", called a dollar sign or currency symbol, are considered to be letters.
A good practice followed by many Java programmers is to not use _ or $ in programmer-created identifiers.
