# Describe and give example Java code to detect multiple features
A programmer can use multiple if statements in sequence to detect multiple features with independent actions.
Multiple sequential if statements looks similar to a multi-branch if-else statement but has a very different meaning.
Each if-statement is independent, and thus more than one branch can execute, in contrast to the multi-branch if-else arrangement.
```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class AgeStats {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Scanner scnr = new Scanner(System.in);
      int userAge;

      System.out.print("Enter age: ");
      userAge = scnr.nextInt();

      // Note that more than one "if" statement can execute
      if (userAge < 16) {
         System.out.println("Enjoy your early years.");
      }

      if (userAge > 15) {
         System.out.println("You are old enough to drive.");
      }

      if (userAge > 17) {
         System.out.println("You are old enough to vote.");
      }

      if (userAge > 24) {
         System.out.println("Most car rental companies will rent to you.");
      }

      if (userAge > 34) {
         System.out.println("You can run for president.");
      }
   }
}
```
output:

Enter age: 12

Enjoy your early years.

...

Enter age: 27

You are old enough to drive.

You are old enough to vote.

Most car rental companies will rent to you.

...

Enter age: 99

You are old enough to drive.

You are old enough to vote.

Most car rental companies will rent to you.

You can run for president.

# Describe and give example Java code to use nested branches
A branch's statements can include any valid statements, including another if-else statement, which are known as nested if-else statements.
Nested if statements are commonly used to make decisions that are based on multiple features.
Ex: To calculate a discount based on both the number of items purchased and the total cost of those items, one if statement checks the number of items purchased and a nested if statement can check the total cost.
```
if (numItems > 3) {     
   if (totalCost > 100) {       // numItems > 3 and totalCost > 100
      saleDiscount = 20;
   }
   else if (totalCost > 50) {  // numItems > 3 and totalCost > 50
      saleDiscount = 10;
   }
}
else if (numItems > 0) {
   ...
}
```
