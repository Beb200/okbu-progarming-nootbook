# Describe the meaning and use of a constant variable
A good practice is to minimize the use of literal numbers in code. One reason is to improve code readability. 
newPrice = origPrice - 5 is less clear than newPrice = origPrice - priceDiscount.
When a variable represents a literal, the variable's value should not be changed in the code.
If the programmer precedes the variable declaration with the keyword final, then the compiler will report an error if a later statement tries to change that variable's value.
An initialized variable whose value cannot change is called a constant variable.
A constant variable is also known as a final variable. A common convention, or good practice, is to name constant variables using upper case letters with words separated by underscores, to make constant variables clearly visible in code.
