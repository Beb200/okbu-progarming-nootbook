# Describe integer division
When the operands of / are integers, the operator performs integer division, which does not generate any fraction.

# Describe integer modulo
The modulo operator (%) evaluates the remainder of the division of two integer operands.
Examples:
- 9 % 5 is 4. Reason: Since 9 = 5 * 1 + 4, the integer division 9 / 5 results in 1, and the remainder is 4.
- 70 % 7 is 0. Reason: 70 / 7 is 10 with remainder 0.
- 1 % 2 is 1. Reason: 1 / 2 is 0 with remainder 1.

# Demonstrate the use of Java integer division and modulo (no answer needed in the homework)
### Division and modulo example: Minutes to hours/minutes.
```

import java.util.Scanner;

public class TimeConverter {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Scanner scnr = new Scanner(System.in);
      int userMinutes; // User input: Minutes
      int outHours;    // Output hours
      int outMinutes;  // Output minutes (remaining)

      System.out.print("Enter minutes: ");
      userMinutes = scnr.nextInt();

      outHours   = userMinutes / 60;
      outMinutes = userMinutes % 60;

      System.out.print(userMinutes  + " minutes is ");
      System.out.print(outHours     + " hours and ");
      System.out.println(outMinutes + " minutes.");
   }
}
```
### output:\n
Enter minutes:  137
137 minutes is 2 hours and 17 minutes.

...

Enter minutes:  180
180 minutes is 3 hours and 0 minutes.
