# Describe the purpose of the main() method and the steps to implement one
The `main()` method can be defined within a programmer-defined class and create objects of that class type.
The BasicCar class defined in the example below represents a car that keeps track of the number of miles driven.
BasicCar has a field that maintains the miles driven and three methods that set, retrieve, and modify the object's field.

`main()` is a static method that is independent of class objects.
`main()` can access other static methods and static fields of the class, but cannot directly access non-static methods or fields, like BasicCar's `checkOdometer()` method.
So, a programmer must create objects within `main()` to call non-static methods on those objects.
Ex: BasicCar's `main()` creates two objects of type BasicCar and performs operations on those objects.

Non-static fields and methods are also called instance variables and instance methods.

```
public class BasicCar {

   // Total miles driven by the car
   private int milesDriven;
    
   // Constructor assigns initial values to instance variables
   public BasicCar() {
      milesDriven = 0;   
   }

   // Drive the requested miles
   public void drive(int tripMiles) {
      milesDriven = milesDriven + tripMiles;
   }

   // Return total number of miles driven
   public int checkOdometer() {
      return milesDriven;
   }

   // Main() creates objects of type BasicCar and 
   // calls methods to operate on the objects
   public static void main(String [] args) {
      BasicCar redCorvette = new BasicCar();
      BasicCar fordMustang = new BasicCar();

      redCorvette.drive(100);        
      fordMustang.drive(75);
      fordMustang.drive(300);
      fordMustang.drive(50);        
   }
}
```
