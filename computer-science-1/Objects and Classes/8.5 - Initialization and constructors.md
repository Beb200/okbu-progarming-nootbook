# Describe the purpose and use of a constructor
Java provides a special class member method, known as a constructor, that is called when an object of that class type is created, and which can be used to initialize all fields.
The constructor has the same name as the class. The constructor method has no return type, not even void. Ex: `public Restaurant() {...}` defines a constructor for the Restaurant class.

A programmer specifies the constructor that should be called when creating an object.
Ex: `Restaurant favLunchPlace = new Restaurant();` creates a new Restaurant object and calls the constructor Restaurant().

If a class does not have a programmer-defined constructor, then the Java compiler implicitly defines a default constructor with no arguments.
The Java compiler also initializes all fields to their default values.
