# Describe a mutator
A mutator method may modify ("mutate") a class' fields.
# Describe an accessor
An accessor method accesses fields but may not modify a class' fields.
# Describe a setter / getter
Commonly, a field has two associated methods: a mutator for setting the value, and an accessor for getting the value, known as a setter and getter method, respectively, and typically with names starting with set or get.
Other mutators and accessors may exist that aren't associated with just one field
# Describe a private helper method
A programmer commonly creates private methods, known as private helper methods, to help public methods carry out tasks.
