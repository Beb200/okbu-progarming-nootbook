# Describe the purpose of unit testing
Unit testing means to create and run a testbench for a specific item (or "unit") like a method or a class.
# Describe the purpose of a test case
Like a chef who tastes food before serving, a class creator should test a class before allowing use.
A testbench is a program whose job is to thoroughly test another program (or portion) via a series of input/output checks known as test cases.
# Describe border cases
Unusual or extreme test case values like 0, negative numbers, or large numbers.
# Describe regression testing
Regression testing means to retest an item like a class anytime that item is changed; if previously-passed test cases fail, the item has "regressed".

A testbench should be maintained along with the item, to always be usable for regression testing.

Testbenches may be complex, with thousands of test cases.
Various tools support testing, and companies employ test engineers who only test other programmers' items.
A large percent, like 50% or more, of commercial software development time may go into testing.
