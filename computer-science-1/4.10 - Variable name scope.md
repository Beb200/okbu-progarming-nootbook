# Describe Java scope
A declared name is only valid within a region of code known as the name's scope.
Ex: A variable userNum declared in main() is only valid within main(), from the declaration to main()'s end.
Most of this material declares variables at the top of main() (and if the reader has studied methods, at the top of other methods).
However, a variable may be declared within other blocks too.

# Describe a block
A block is a brace-enclosed {...} sequence of statements, such as found with an if-else, for loop, or while loop.
A variable name's scope extends from the declaration to the closing brace }.

# Describe a variable name's scope
```
public class VariableScope {
  public static void main (String[] args) {
     // int val1  = userNum;    // ERROR
     int userNum = 2;           // Name valid to main's "}"
     int newNum  = userNum + 1;
     int i;

     for (i = 0; i < newNum; ++i) {
        int valSquared;        // Name valid to for's "}"
        valSquared = userNum * userNum;
        System.out.println("" + i + " squared: " + valSquared);
     }

     // System.out.println("Last value: " + valSquared); // ERROR
  }
}
```
