# Describe the purpose of output formatting 
A programmer can adjust the way that a program's output appears, a task known as output formatting.
The standard output stream System.out provides the methods printf() and format() for output formatting. 
Both methods are equivalent, so this discussion only refers to printf().

# Describe the purpose and use of a format string
The first argument of the printf() method, the format string, specifies the format of the text to print along with any number of placeholders for printing values. 
The placeholders are known as format specifiers.

# Describe the purpose and use of a format specifier
A format specifier specifies the type of value to print in its place.
A format specifier begins with the % character followed by another character that indicates the value type to be printed.
Ex: `%d` indicates an integer type, and `%s` indicates a string type.

# Provide example code for the use of the format string
```
String account = "Prime";
double total = 210.35;
int years = 5;

System.out.printf("The %s account saved you $%f over %d years\n",
    account, total, years);

```
Output:

The Prime account saved 
you $210.350000 over 5 
years



|Format specifier |	Data type(s) | Notes
|---|---|---|
|%c|	char|	Prints a single Unicode character|
|%d|	int, long, short|	Prints a decimal integer value.|
|%o|	int, long, short|	Prints an octal integer value.|
|%h|	int, char, long, short|	Prints a hexadecimal integer value.|
|%f|	float, double|	Prints a floating-point value.|
|%e|	float, double|	Prints a floating-point value in scientific notation.|
|%s|	String|	Prints the characters in a String variable or literal.|
|%%|		|Prints the "%" character.|
|%n|		|Prints the platform-specific new-line character.|

Floating-point formatting.
|Sub-specifier|	Description|	Example|
|---|---|---|
|width|	Specifies the minimum number of characters to print. If the formatted value has more characters than the width, the value will not be truncated. If the formatted value has fewer characters than the width, the output will be padded with spaces (or 0's if the '0' flag is specified).|	printf("Value: %7.2f", myFloat); Value:   12.34|
|.precision|	Specifies the number of digits to print following the decimal point. If the precision is not specified, a default precision of 6 is used.|	printf("%.4f", myFloat);12.3400 printf("%3.4e", myFloat);1.2340e+01|
|flags|	-: Left aligns the output given the specified width, padding the output with spaces. +: Prints a preceding + sign for positive values. Negative numbers are always printed with the - sign. 0: Pads the output with 0's when the formatted value has fewer characters than the width. space: Prints a preceding space for positive value.|	printf("%+f", myFloat); +12.340000 printf("%08.2f", myFloat); 00012.34|

Integer formatting.
|Sub-specifier|	Description|	Example|
|---|---|---|
|width|	Specifies the minimum number of characters to print. If the formatted value has more characters than the width, the value will not be truncated. If the formatted value has fewer characters than the width, the output will be padded with spaces (or 0's if the '0' flag is specified).|	printf("Value: %7d", myInt); Value:     301|
|flags|	-: Left aligns the output given the specified width, padding the output with spaces. +: Print a preceding + sign for positive values. Negative numbers are always printed with the - sign. 0: Pads the output with 0's when the formatted value has fewer characters than the width. space: Prints a preceding space for positive value.|	printf("%+d", myInt); +301 printf("%08d", myInt); 00000301 printf("%+08d", myInt); +0000301|

String formatting.
|Sub-specifier|	Description|	Example|
|---|---|---|
|width|	Specifies the minimum number of characters to print. If the string has more characters than the width, the value will not be truncated. If the formatted value has fewer characters than the width, the output will be padded with spaces.|	printf("%20s String", myString); Formatting String|
|.precision|	Specifies the maximum number of characters to print. If the string has more characters than the precision, the string will be truncated.| printf("%.6s", myString); Format|
|flags|	-: Left aligns the output given the specified width, padding the output with spaces.|	printf("%-20s String", myString); Formatting           String|
