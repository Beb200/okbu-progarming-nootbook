# Describe and give example Java code to detect if two items are equal
An if statement executes a group of statements if an expression is true. Braces surround the if branch's statements.
Braces { }, sometimes redundantly called curly braces, represent a grouping, such as a grouping of statements. 
Note: { } are braces, [ ] are brackets.

The example below uses ==.
The equality operator (==) evaluates to true if the left and right sides are equal.
Ex: If numYears is 50, then numYears == 50 evaluates to true. Note the equality operator is ==, not =.

Good practice is to indent a branch's statements, using a consistent number of spaces. This material indents 3 spaces.
```
public static void main (String [] args) {
   Scanner scnr = new Scanner(System.in);   
   int hotelRate;
   int numYears;

   hotelRate = 150;

   System.out.print("Enter years married: ");
   numYears = scnr.nextInt();

   if (numYears == 50) {
      System.out.print("Congrats on 50 years ");
      System.out.println("of marriage!");

      hotelRate = hotelRate / 2;
   }

   System.out.print("Your hotel rate: ");
   System.out.println(hotelRate);
}
```
output:

Enter years married: 50 

Congrats on 50 years of marriage!

Your hotel rate: 75

# Describe and give example Java code to select among two options (you can just print out the result of the selection)
An if-else statement executes one group of statements when an expression is true, and another group of statements when the expression is false.
In the example below, the if-else statement outputs if a number entered by the user is even or odd. The if statement executes if divRemainder is equal to 0, and the else statement executes if divRemainder is not equal to 0.
```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class EvenOdd{
   public static void main (String[] args) {
      Scanner scnr = new Scanner(System.in);
      int userNum;
      int divRemainder;

      System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
      userNum = scnr.nextInt();

      divRemainder = userNum % 2;

      if (divRemainder == 0) {
         System.out.println(userNum + " is even.");
      }
      else {
         System.out.println(userNum + " is odd.");
      }
   }
}
```
Output: 

Enter a number: 22

22 is even

Enter a number: 45

45 is odd

# Describe and give example Java code to select among more than two options (print the result)
Commonly, a program may need to detect several specific values of a variable.
An If-else statement can be extended to have three (or more) branches. Each branch's expression is checked in sequence.
As soon as one branch's expression is found to be true, that branch's statements execute (and no subsequent branch is considered). 
If no expression is true, the else branch executes. The example below detects values of 1, 10, 25, or 50 for variable numYears.
```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class MultIfElseAnniv {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Scanner scnr = new Scanner(System.in);
      int numYears;

      System.out.print("Enter number years married: ");
      numYears = scnr.nextInt();

      if (numYears == 1) {
         System.out.println("Your first year -- great!");
      }
      else if (numYears == 10) {
         System.out.println("A whole decade -- impressive.");
      }
      else if (numYears == 25) {
         System.out.println("Your silver anniversary -- enjoy.");
      }
      else if (numYears == 50) {
         System.out.println("Your golden anniversary -- amazing.");
      }
      else {
         System.out.println("Nothing special.");
      }
   }
}
```

Output:

Enter number years married: 10
A whole decade -- impressive.

...

Enter number years married: 25
Your silver anniversary -- enjoy.

...

Enter number years married: 30
Nothing special.

...

Enter number years married: 1
Your first year -- great!
