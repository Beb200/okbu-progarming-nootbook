# Explain short circuit evaluation
A logical operator evaluates operands from left to right.
Short circuit evaluation skips evaluating later operands if the result of the logical operator can already be determined.
The logical AND operator short circuits to false if the first operand evaluates to false, and skips evaluating the second operand.
The logical OR operator short circuits to true if the first operand is true, and skips evaluating the second operand.

| Operator | Example | Short circuit evaluation |
|---|---|---|
|operand1 && operand2|	true && operand2| 	If the first operand evaluates to true, operand2 is evaluated.|
| |false && operand2|	If the first operand evaluates to false, the result of the AND operation is always false, so operand2 is not evaluated.|
|operand1 \|\| operand2|	true \|\| operand2|	If the first operand evaluates to true, the result of the OR operation is always true, so operand2 is not evaluated.|
| |false \|\| operand2|	If the first operand evaluates to false, operand2 is evaluated.|
