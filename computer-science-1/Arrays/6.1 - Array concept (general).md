# Describe the concept of an array
A typical variable stores one data item, like the number 59 or the character 'a'.
Instead, sometimes a list of data items should be stored.
Ex: A program recording points scored in each quarter of a basketball game needs a list of 4 numbers.
Requiring a programmer to declare 4 variables is annoying; 200 variables would be ridiculous.
An array is a special variable having one name, but storing a list of data items, with each item being directly accessible.
Some languages use a construct similar to an array called a vector. 

# Describe an array element
Each item in an array is known as an element.

# Describe the purpose of an index in an array
In an array, each element's location number is called the index, myArray[2] has index 2.
An array's key feature is that the index enables direct access to any element, as in myArray[2]; different languages may use different syntax, like myArray(3) or myVector.at(3).
In many languages, indices start with 0 rather than 1, so an array with 4 elements has indices 0, 1, 2, and 3.
