# Describe (in detail) an algorithm to swap two variables
Sometimes a program must swap values among two variables.
Swapping two variables x and y means to assign y's value to x, and x's value to y.
If x is 33 and y is 55, then after swapping x is 55 and y is 33.

A common method for swapping uses a temporary variable. A temporary variable is a variable used briefly to store a value.
To understand the intuition of such temporary storage, consider a person holding a book in one hand and a phone in the other, wishing to swap the items.
The person can temporarily place the phone on a table, move the book to the other hand, then pick up the phone.

Similarly, swapping two variables can use a third variable to temporarily hold one value while the other value is copied over.

If you have studied arrays or vectors (or other kinds of lists), know that most swaps are actually performed between two list elements.
For example, reversing a list with N elements can be achieved by swapping element 1 and N, element 2 and N-1, element 3 and N-2, etc.
(stopping at the middle of the list).
