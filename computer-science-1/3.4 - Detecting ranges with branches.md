# Describe and give example Java code to detect a range (using logical operators and gaps)
Programmers commonly use the sequential nature of the multi-branch if-else arrangement to detect ranges of numbers.
In the following example, the second branch expression is only reached if the first expression is false.
So the second branch is taken if userAge < 16 is false (so 16 or greater) AND userAge is < 25, meaning userAge is between 16 - 24 (inclusive).
```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class MultIfElseInsur {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      int userAge;
      int insurancePrice;
      Scanner scnr = new Scanner(System.in);

      System.out.print("Enter your age: ");
      userAge = scnr.nextInt();

      if (userAge < 16) {       // Age 15 and under
         System.out.println("Too young.");
         insurancePrice = 0;
      }
      else if (userAge < 25) {  // Age 16 - 24
       insurancePrice = 4800;
      }
      else if (userAge < 40) {  // Age 25 - 39
         insurancePrice = 2350;
      }
      else {                    // Age 40 and up
         insurancePrice = 2100;
      }

      System.out.println("Annual price: $" + insurancePrice);
   }
}
```
Output:

Enter your age: 

27

Annual price: $2350
